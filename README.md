# Module Bidding App

This is a PHP/HTML web application that simulates a university module bidding system. 

For each semester, a student is assigned a specific amount of bidding credits by the system. In order to register for a module, a student has to go through several rounds of bidding, where they can make various decisions such as: add bid, update bid, delete bid and drop module.

This application accomodates multiple students, and modules are assigned based on 1) capacity of the classes 2) bidding processing logic specified by our clients.
